Goal is to count the reads over peaks of some kind (likely chip or atac peaks) and do differental expression. Problem is that sometimes the peaks may be bais towards all upregulated. So we will also count the reads over all genes. Then we will do differental expression using only the genes as the contorl genes (which are used for size factors). 


scripts

1) making saf files
	makesaf_frombed.R #saf file for peaks
		input: bed file
                output: saf file
	makesaf.R #saf file for genes	
		input: bed file
		output: saf file

2) count reads over saf file
	countsaf.R
	input: filelist(yanked from a metadata table), saf file from first step #check out my metadata table as an example
	output: count(coverage) table as csv, several other tables with information about the counts (stat, annotation, targets)

3) running Deseq
	several ways of running deseq
